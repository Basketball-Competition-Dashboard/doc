#### Introduction

The OpenAPI Specification is a standardized way to describe, produce, and consume RESTful APIs. It provides a language-agnostic, human-readable format for defining API endpoints, request/response models, and operations.

The Swagger framework, which is part of the OpenAPI ecosystem, provides a set of tools and libraries for building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. Swagger tools, such as Swagger Editor, Swagger UI, and Swagger Codegen, help developers design, build, and document APIs that conform to the OpenAPI Specification.

By using OpenAPI and Swagger, developers can promote consistency, collaboration, and ease of integration between different systems and development teams.
